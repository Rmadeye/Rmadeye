# Hello there! ðŸ‘‹
I'm RafaÅ‚, a PhD in Chemical Sciences, working with a strong focus on **python programming** and **data science**, especially in context of structural bioinformatics and related studies.

I began my career as a traditional wet-lab scientist, but discovery of the power of Python and Bash led me to transition into world of structural biology-related **bioinformatics** and **data science**. My expertise lies in structure-oriented python programming, data science, protein folding and analysis, molecular docking, molecular dynamics, computer-aided drug design (CADD), and molecular modelling. More recently, I started applying Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques to biological and chemical data.

For my research, I rely on a range of powerful tools and technologies, such as:

- **Python** (pandas, numpy, seaborn, scikit-learn, torch, wandb, rdkit, biopandas, and occasionaly flask, streamlit and biopython)
- **Bash** (as a Linux user and Admin)
- **HPC** (for scientific calculations using cloud computing with SLURM queue system, AWS in progres..)
- **AMBER** (for Molecular Dynamics simulations)
- **Gnina/vina/diffdock** (for molecular docking)
- **Rosetta** (for versatile protein analysis)
- **Colabfold** (for AF2 protein folding)
- **ESMfold**
- **USAlign** (for screening proper folding)

Throughout my career, I've been involved in a variety of biology-related projects, including:

- Application of Graph Neural Networks in structural features of coiled-coil domains
- Prediction of nucleotide reacticivity in RNA sequence in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/stanford-ribonanza-rna-folding/overview), where my team was awarded with bronze medal as we reached top 10% of prediction accuracy
- Biodegradation of nitroarenes [Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9717/9/1/105?About=Link)
- Development of selective inhibitors for alkaline phosphatases [Publication](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1093326320305908)
- Treatment strategies for Novichok poisoning [Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/29/2/338)
- Investigating GPCR receptors [Publication](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2023/FO/D2FO03412C)
- Exploring Rossmann fold domains [Publication](https://academic.oup.com/bib/article/23/1/bbab371/6375059)
- Establishing a pipeline for an AI-based model to predict new drug candidates [Publication](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07391102.2021.1898474)

Curious to know more about my scientific background, publications, and achievements? Check out my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KE99D40AAAAJ&hl=pl).

Currently, I'm tackling the challenge of resolving improper folding of Connexin proteins, which contributes to a wide range of inherited diseases, including the personal aspect of **Charcot-Marie-Tooth 1X syndrome**.

In the meantime, I'm extending my knowledge about **Deep Learning** and doing **AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner CLF-C02** course.

If you have any questions or need assistance with AlphaFold2, USalign, Rosetta, or AMBER, feel free to reach out!

Currently, I'm looking for **python** and **data-oriented** positions in the IT.

Are you an employer intrigued by my projects and expertise, and believe I'd be a valuable addition to your company? Don't hesitate to get in touch with me!
