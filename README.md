# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
I'm RafaÅ‚, a PhD in Chemical Sciences, with a strong focus on structural bioinformatics and related studies.

I began my career as a traditional wet-lab scientist, but discovery of the power of Python and Bash led me to transition into world of structural biology-related bioinformatics. My expertise lies in structure-oriented python programming, data sciences, protein folding and analysis, molecular docking, molecular dynamics, computer-aided drug design (CADD), and molecular modelling. More recently, I started applying Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques to biological and chemical topics.

Throughout my career, I've been involved in a variety of biology-related projects, including:

- Biodegradation of nitroarenes
- Development of selective inhibitors for alkaline phosphatases
- Treatment strategies for Novichok poisoning
- Investigating GPCR receptors
- Exploring Rossmann fold domains
- Establishing a pipeline for an AI-based model to predict new drug candidates

For my research endeavors, I heavily rely on a range of powerful tools and technologies, such as:

- Python (leveraging pandas, numpy, some scikit-learn/torch, rdkit, biopandas, and occasionally biopython)
- Bash (as a Linux user, including SLURM for cloud computing and automation of anything what is worth)
- AMBER (for Molecular Dynamics simulations)
- Gnina/vina/diffdock (for molecular docking)
- Rosetta (for versatile protein analysis)
- Colabfold (for AF2 protein folding)
- ESMfold
- USAlign (for screening proper folding)

Curious to know more about my scientific background, publications, and achievements? Check out my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KE99D40AAAAJ&hl=pl).

Currently, I'm tackling the challenge of resolving improper folding of Connexin proteins, which contributes to a wide range of inherited diseases, including the personal aspect of Charcot-Marie-Tooth 1X syndrome.

If you have any questions or need assistance with AlphaFold2, USalign, Rosetta, or AMBER, feel free to reach out!

Are you an employer intrigued by my projects and expertise, and believe I'd be a valuable addition to your company? Don't hesitate to get in touch with me!
